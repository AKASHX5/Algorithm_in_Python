    "# Insertion Sort\n",
    "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.The insertion sort, although still __O(n^2)__, works in a slightly different way. It always maintains a sorted sublist in the lower positions of the list. Each new item is then “inserted” back into the previous sublist such that the sorted sublist is one item larger.We begin by assuming that a list with one item (position 0) is already sorted. On each pass, one for each item 1 through n−1, the current item is checked against those in the already sorted sublist. As we look back into the already sorted sublist, we shift those items that are greater to the right. When we reach a smaller item or the end of the sublist, the current item can be inserted."

    "# Merge Sort\n",
    "o using a divide and conquer strategy as a way to improve the performance of sorting algorithms. The first algorithm we will study is the merge sort. Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half. If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves. Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called a merge, is performed. Merging is the process of taking two smaller sorted lists and combining them together into a single, sorted, new list.The merge sort has a time complelxity of __O(n log n)__\n",

The role of the pivot value is to assist with splitting the list. The actual position where the pivot value belongs in the final sorted list, commonly called the split point, will be used to divide the list for subsequent calls to the quick sort.Partitioning begins by locating two position markers—let’s call them __leftmark__ and __rightmark__—at the beginning and end of the remaining items in the list.We begin by incrementing __leftmark__ until we locate a value that is greater than the pivot value. We then decrement __rightmark__ until we find a value that is less than the pivot value. At this point we have discovered two items that are out of place with respect to the eventual split point\n",
